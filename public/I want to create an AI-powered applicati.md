I want to create an AI-powered application with HTML, CSS, Java Script & openai to address challenges faced in project development within corporate environments.

In most companies, team members (e.g., front-end developers, back-end developers, testers) often struggle with unclear or incomplete user stories. This leads to multiple issues such as:

Lack of domain knowledge

Incomplete or unclear requirements

Difficulty in understanding acceptance criteria

Challenges in story estimation

Missing details for backend integration (API contracts, request/response payloads, database schema, queries, etc.)

Complexity and dependency analysis gaps

Unidentified risks and potential blockers

Unforeseen surprises during development

Unclear definition of done

Currently, one of the biggest problems is that Jira stories are often not well-defined. Acceptance criteria are vague, domain knowledge is missing, and when new members join, they struggle to understand existing functionality. This leads to delays, rework, and inefficiency.

To overcome these challenges, I am looking to develop an AI-based application that can:

Analyze Jira stories and identify missing details.

Provide domain and functional context for developers.

Auto-generate API request/response contracts, database schema suggestions, and possible dependencies.

Help estimate story complexity and timeline.

Suggest risk factors and dependencies proactively.

Define and validate acceptance criteria.

Ensure a clear “definition of done” for every story.

This application should act as an AI-powered project assistant, helping teams bridge knowledge gaps, improve clarity, and enhance overall productivity in software development.
